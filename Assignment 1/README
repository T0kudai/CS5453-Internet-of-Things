UAV Simulation
=============================

Running the code
-----------------------------
The code relies on numpy library for some functions. This will be installed when execution is started.
If the numpy library is already present no changes will be made. In case you do not want this behaviour, remove the lines,
start powershell "pip install numpy"
pause
from run.ps1.

Make sure HiveMQTT is up and running before starting this program.
Keep all input files in a folder named sample_inputs where file to be opened by HQ is vehicle_location.txt and UAV files are uav1.txt, uav2.txt, ...
Execute the run.ps1 file in Powershell inside Windows environment. The program will install numpy library on your system. Wait for numpy to be installed.
Once numpy is installed, press the enter key on the terminal that says "Press Enter key to continue."
Once done, the execution will start and wait till execution is completed.
Once execution is completed, the terminal windows running HQ.py code will automatically close. Other windows need to be closed manually.
The results will be available in output.txt file..
